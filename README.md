# GameASCII - A terminal graphics library with added features for (simple) game development.

TEST RELEASE OUT - More features very soon! 👍

# FUNCTIONS

### create_canvas: 
Create a canvas where shapes and pixels will be drawn. Takes a width and height.

### draw_rect: 
Draw a rect on the canvas. Takes an x position, y position, width, height and the canvas. If the rectangle dimensions go out of scope from the canvas (pixels not drawn on the canvas), this part wont be drawn without a visual indicator.

### push_to_console: 
Print the canvas to the console.

### clear_screen: 
Clears the terminal window (runs "cls"/"clear" depending on os). Takes the canvas.

### get_axis:
Get the x and y axis (for now the WASD keys). Takes the axis, "horizontal" or "vertical" and a value. This value will be returned as -value or value depending on the keys pressed.
